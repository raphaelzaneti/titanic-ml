# Titanic - ML from disaster

## Disclaimer
This is my first Data Science project. So there are a lot of adjusts to do. After some months of study, I intend to adjust some parts of the project, in order to get a better accuracy score of the model and include some data visualization to ilustrate the conclusions. 

### Project Overview
This is a Jupyter Notebook machine learning model to determine if a group of passengers should or should not survive on Titanic disaster. The model take some variables like passenger age, gender, port or embarkation and others, and determine the odds to the traveler survive to the disaster. 

The project is part of a Kaggle competition challenge, as a practice exercise to Data Science begginers improve their capacities.

### Details about dataset
The details about dataset and other information about the competition can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic">here</a>

### Results
For the submition of this version of the project, I've achieved an accuracy score of 78.2% of the results of test.csv. 

### Technologies used in this project
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas lib
- Numpy lib
- Scikit-learn lib

### What was my motivation?
As a software developer, I found the need to improve my habilities with data handling. From data gattering to data processing and analysis, I believe that these skills are very usefull to a IT professional, like me.

This is my first Data Science project, and I'm aware that there is a lot of work to do to improve my skills of data processing, data interpretation and presentation of resutls. 

### Why did I build this project?
It seems to be a nice "Hello world!" in Data Science. 

### What problem does it solve?
If we have another disaster similar to Titanic, we already have a ML model to determine the probable survivors. 

### What did I learn?
I learnd how to use basic Python libs to treat and interpret data. Also, that was a nice start in machine learning, as I had the oportunity to study about Decision Trees and Random Forests. 

### Future plans
I intend to keep moving forward in Data Science, beeing capable to develop more complex ML models to solve problems of the real world.
